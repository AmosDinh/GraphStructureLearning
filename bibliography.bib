@article{Guan.2022,
 abstract = {The rapid development of smart factories, combined with the increasing complexity of production equipment, has resulted in a large number of multivariate time series that can be recorded using sensors during the manufacturing process. The anomalous patterns of industrial production may be hidden by these time series. Previous LSTM-based and machine-learning-based approaches have made fruitful progress in anomaly detection. However, these multivariate time series anomaly detection algorithms do not take into account the correlation and time dependence between the sequences. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm framework, namely, graph attention network and temporal convolutional network for multivariate time series anomaly detection (GTAD), to address this problem. Specifically, we first utilized temporal convolutional networks, including causal convolution and dilated convolution, to capture temporal dependencies, and then used graph neural networks to obtain correlations between sensors. Finally, we conducted sufficient experiments on three public benchmark datasets, and the results showed that the proposed method outperformed the baseline method, achieving detection results with F1 scores higher than 95{\%} on all datasets.},

%  abstract = {This paper investigates a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework, and modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Machine learning has the potential to assist many communities in using the large datasets that are becoming more and more available. Unfortunately, much of that potential is not being realized because it would require sharing data in a way that compromises privacy. In this paper, we investigate a method for ensuring (differential) privacy of the generator of the Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN) framework. The resulting model can be used for generating synthetic data on which algorithms can be trained and validated, and on which competitions can be conducted, without compromising the privacy of the original dataset. Our method modifies the Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE) framework and applies it to GANs. Our modified framework (which we call PATE-GAN) allows us to tightly bound the influence of any individual sample on the model, resulting in tight differential privacy guarantees and thus an improved performance over models with the same guarantees. We also look at measuring the quality of synthetic data from a new angle; we assert that for the synthetic data to be useful for machine learning researchers, the relative performance of two algorithms (trained and tested) on the synthetic dataset should be the same as their relative performance (when trained and tested) on the original dataset. Our experiments, on various datasets, demonstrate that PATE-GAN consistently outperforms the stateof-the-art method with respect to this and other notions of synthetic data quality.},

 abstract = {Synthetic data is an increasingly popular tool for training deep learning models, especially in computer vision but also in other areas. In this work, we attempt to provide a comprehensive survey of the various directions in the development and application of synthetic data. First, we discuss synthetic datasets for basic computer vision problems, both low-level (e.g., optical flow estimation) and high-level (e.g., semantic segmentation), synthetic environments and datasets for outdoor and urban scenes (autonomous driving), indoor scenes (indoor navigation), aerial navigation, simulation environments for robotics, applications of synthetic data outside computer vision (in neural programming, bioinformatics, NLP, and more); we also survey the work on improving synthetic data development and alternative ways to produce it such as GANs. Second, we discuss in detail the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem that inevitably arises in applications of synthetic data, including synthetic-to-real refinement with GAN-based models and domain adaptation at the feature/model level without explicit data transformations. Third, we turn to privacy-related applications of synthetic data and review the work on generating synthetic datasets with differential privacy guarantees. We conclude by highlighting the most promising directions for further work in synthetic data studies.},

%  abstract = {TimeEval is presented, an extensible, scal-able and automatic benchmarking toolkit for time series anomaly detection algorithms that includes an extensive data generator and supports both interactive and batch evaluation scenarios. Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series is an important task in time series analytics because it serves the identification of special events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker. Consequently, many algorithms have been developed for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The enormous number of approaches (i.e., more than 158 as of today), the lack of properly labeled test data, and the complexity of time series anomaly benchmarking have, though, led to a situation where choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge. In this demonstration, we present TimeEval, an extensible, scal-able and automatic benchmarking toolkit for time series anomaly detection algorithms. TimeEval includes an extensive data generator and supports both interactive and batch evaluation scenarios. With our novel toolkit, we aim to ease the evaluation effort and help the community to provide more meaningful evaluations.},

Most of the time series anomaly detection papers tested on a handful of popular benchmark datasets, created by Yahoo [1], Numenta [2], NASA [3] or Pei{\&}{\#}39;s Lab (OMNI) [4], etc. There is a strong implicit assumption that doing well on these public datasets is a sufficient condition to declare an anomaly detection algorithm is useful. In this work, we make a surprising claim.

Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

 abstract = {This paper systematically investigates the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance and provides a comparative analysis of methods available for defining precision in a probabilistic sense to promote a better understanding of the various issues involved in retrieval performance evaluation. Recall and precision are often used to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. They are easy to define if there is a single query and if the retrieval result generated for the query is a linear ordering. However, when the retrieval results are weakly ordered, in the sense that several documents have an identical retrieval status value with respect to a query, some probabilistic notion of precision has to be introduced. Relevance probability, expected precision, and so forth, are some alternatives mentioned in the literature for this purpose. Furthermore, when many queries are to be evaluated and the retrieval results averaged over these queries, some method of interpolation of precision values at certain preselected recall levels is needed. The currently popular approaches for handling both a weak ordering and interpolation are found to be inconsistent, and the results obtained are not easy to interpret. Moreover, in cases where some alternatives are available, no comparative analysis that would facilitate the selection of a particular strategy has been provided. In this paper, we systematically investigate the various problems and issues associated with the use of recall and precision as measures of retrieval system performance. Our motivation is to provide a comparative analysis of methods available for defining precision in a probabilistic sense and to promote a better understanding of the various issues involved in retrieval performance evaluation.},

@article{Ahmad.2017,
 abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

 abstract = {This work evaluates the social representation of the space structure between two or more active participants, so-called F-Formation for small gatherings, and proposes calculating body orientation and location from skeleton joint data sets by integrating depth cameras. Analysing the dynamics in social interactions in indoor spaces entails evaluating spatial--temporal variables from the event, such as location and time. Additionally, social interactions include invisible spaces that we unconsciously acknowledge due to social constraints, e.g., space between people having a conversation with each other. Nevertheless, current sensor arrays focus on detecting the physically occupied spaces from social interactions, i.e., areas inhabited by physically measurable objects. Our goal is to detect the socially occupied spaces, i.e., spaces not physically occupied by subjects and objects but inhabited by the interaction they sustain. We evaluate the social representation of the space structure between two or more active participants, so-called F-Formation for small gatherings. We propose calculating body orientation and location from skeleton joint data sets by integrating depth cameras. The body orientation is derived by integrating the shoulders and spine joint data with head/face rotation data and spatial--temporal information from trajectories. From the physically occupied measurements, we can detect socially occupied spaces. In our user study implementing the system, we compared the capabilities and skeleton tracking datasets from three depth camera sensors, the Kinect v2, Azure Kinect, and Zed 2i. We collected 32 walking patterns for individual and dyad configurations and evaluated the system's accuracy regarding the intended and socially accepted orientations. Experimental results show accuracy above 90{\%} for the Kinect v2, 96{\%} for the Azure Kinect, and 89{\%} for the Zed 2i for assessing socially relevant body orientation. Our algorithm contributes to the anonymous and automated assessment of socially occupied spaces. The depth sensor system is promising in detecting more complex social structures. These findings impact research areas that study group interactions within complex indoor settings.},

 abstract = {Anomaly detection for time-series data has been an important research field for a long time. Seminal work on anomaly detection methods has been focussing on statistical approaches. In recent years an increasing number of machine learning algorithms have been developed to detect anomalies on time-series. Subsequently, researchers tried to improve these techniques using (deep) neural networks. In the light of the increasing number of anomaly detection methods, the body of research lacks a broad comparative evaluation of statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods. This paper studies 20 univariate anomaly detection methods from the all three categories. The evaluation is conducted on publicly available datasets, which serve as benchmarks for time-series anomaly detection. By analyzing the accuracy of each method as well as the computation time of the algorithms, we provide a thorough insight about the performance of these anomaly detection approaches, alongside some general notion of which method is suited for a certain type of data.},

@book{Marteau.2017,
 abstract = {From the identification of a drawback in the Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm that limits its use in the scope of anomaly detection, we propose two extensions that allow to firstly overcome the previously mention limitation and secondly to provide it with some supervised learning capability. The resulting Hybrid Isolation Forest (HIF) that we propose is first evaluated on a synthetic dataset to analyze the effect of the new meta-parameters that are introduced and verify that the addressed limitation of the IF algorithm is effectively overcame. We hen compare the two algorithms on the ISCX benchmark dataset, in the context of a network intrusion detection application. Our experiments show that HIF outperforms IF, but also challenges the 1-class and 2-classes SVM baselines with computational efficiency.

@article{Ryzhikov.2021,
 abstract = {Anomaly detection is a challenging task that frequently arises in practically all areas of industry and science, from fraud detection and data quality monitoring to finding rare cases of diseases and searching for new physics. Most of the conventional approaches to anomaly detection, such as one-class SVM and Robust Auto-Encoder, are one-class classification methods, i.e., focus on separating normal data from the rest of the space. Such methods are based on the assumption of separability of normal and anomalous classes, and subsequently do not take into account any available samples of anomalies. Nonetheless, in practical settings, some anomalous samples are often available; however, usually in amounts far lower than required for a balanced classification task, and the separability assumption might not always hold. This leads to an important task-incorporating known anomalous samples into training procedures of anomaly detection models. In this work, we propose a novel model-agnostic training procedure to address this task. We reformulate one-class classification as a binary classification problem with normal data being distinguished from pseudo-anomalous samples. The pseudo-anomalous samples are drawn from low-density regions of a normalizing flow model by feeding tails of the latent distribution into the model. Such an approach allows to easily include known anomalies into the training process of an arbitrary classifier. We demonstrate that our approach shows comparable performance on one-class problems, and, most importantly, achieves comparable or superior results on tasks with variable amounts of known anomalies.},

%  abstract = {An essential task in predictive maintenance is the prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) through the analysis of multivariate time series. Using the sliding window method, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and conventional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) approaches have produced impressive results on this matter, due to their ability to learn optimized features. However, sequence information is only partially modeled by CNN approaches. Due to the flatten mechanism in conventional RNNs, like Long Short Term Memories (LSTM), the temporal information within the window is not fully preserved. To exploit the multi-level temporal information, many approaches are proposed which combine CNN and RNN models. In this work, we propose a new LSTM variant called embedded convolutional LSTM (ECLSTM). In ECLSTM a group of different 1D convolutions is embedded into the LSTM structure. Through this, the temporal information is preserved between and within windows. Since the hyper-parameters of models require careful tuning, we also propose an automated prediction framework based on the Bayesian optimization with hyperband optimizer, which allows for efficient optimization of the network architecture. Finally, we show the superiority of our proposed ECLSTM approach over the state-of-the-art approaches on several widely used benchmark data sets for RUL Estimation.},
